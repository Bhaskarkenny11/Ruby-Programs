# The `sort_string_by_ascii()` method takes a string as input 
# and returns a new string with the words sorted in order based on their ASCII values.
# The method uses the `sort_by!()` method to sort the words in the input string. 
# The `sort_by!()` method takes a block as an argument, which is used to compare two elements of the array.
#  In this case, the block compares the ASCII values of the two words. 
# The words are sorted in ascending order based on their ASCII values. 
# The method then joins the words into a new string and returns the new string.
# In this example, the input string is "hello world". 
# The output string is "deehllowor". 
# The words in the output string are sorted in order based on their ASCII values.
